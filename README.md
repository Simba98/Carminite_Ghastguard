# Carminite_Ghastguard

Oh no! A Carminite Ghastguard steal your locomotives' power.
Hence your acceleration is limited. This mod provide a more smooth startup of your locomotives and stocks.
Enjoy your game.

# Usage

Drag the jar file as you install mod normally. And acceleration your locomotives  will be limited.

# Tips

Immersive Railroading provides a immersive physical system as its name shows. The total acceleration of stocks as following shows:

$Total\_acceleration=Tractive\_Acceleration+Resistance\_Acceleration+Grade\_Acceleration+Airbrake\_Acceleration$

,where $Tractive\_Acceleration$ is Tractive effort by your locomotives, $Resistance\_Acceleration$ is the resistance, include friction, etc. $Grade\_Acceleration$ is the acceleration due to gravity if the stocks are in a slope. $Airbrake\_Acceleration$ is the effort of airbrake of your locomotives.

This mod only limit the first part: $Tractive\_Acceleration$. Therefore, other physical system will not be changed if you use this mod.
